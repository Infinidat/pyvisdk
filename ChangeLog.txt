Version 0.7 (Aug 18, 2011)
--------------------------
Core Updates
^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Added locale option for the login method.
* Changed `getHosts` to :py:meth:`pyvisdk.vim.getHostSystems`
* Removed `pyvisdk.vim.getVirtualMachinesIter` as it queries the full list anyway.
* Core now uses it's own managed objects.
* :py:meth:`pyvisdk.vim.getObjectProperties` now takes a parent as an argument instead of a collector.
* Now uses data objects for the specs
* Added the method :py:meth:`pyvisdk.new` to :py:mod:`pyvisdk` to shortcut the creation of Vim objects.  Used mostly for testing.

Data Objects and Managed Objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* When methods are called off Managed Objects, arguments that are managed objects make sure the reference is used.
* The return values of methods now return pyvisdk managed objects instead of suds objects (except Retrieve Properties)
* If the name is passed in, but the ref isn't passed in to the managed object, it will search for the managed object.
* All managed objects have name as a property now.
* When updating a property, if the data returned is a list of one element, it will return just the one element instead.
* Added getDecendants method on all managed objects.
* Updated data objects to make sure it uses the signature arguments before inherited arguments.
* Changed from generating the data objects as classes, and instead, generate a factory method that creates the data object for you.
* Updated documentation.

App
^^^
* Updated the options to use all the options available in the perl SDK
* Added more commandline switchs to match the SDK

* Added all enumerations to pyvisdk.enums.
* Added samples directory to implement some of the same samples as the SDK.
