.. describe:: HostSystemPowerState
    Defines a host's power state.
    
    
    .. py:data:: HostSystemPowerState.poweredOff
        The host was specifically powered off by the user through VirtualCenter. This state is not a cetain state, because after VirtualCenter issues the command to power off the host, the host might crash, or kill all the processes but fail to power off.
        
    
    .. py:data:: HostSystemPowerState.poweredOn
        The host is powered on. A host that is entering standby mode entering is also in this state.
        
    
    .. py:data:: HostSystemPowerState.standBy
        The host was specifically put in standby mode, either explicitly by the user, or automatically by DPM. This state is not a cetain state, because after VirtualCenter issues the command to put the host in standby state, the host might crash, or kill all the processes but fail to power off. A host that is exiting standby mode exiting is also in this state.
        
    
    .. py:data:: HostSystemPowerState.unknown
        If the host is disconnected, or notResponding, we cannot possibly have knowledge of its power state. Hence, the host is marked as unknown.
